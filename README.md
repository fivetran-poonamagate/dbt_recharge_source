# ReCharge Source dbt package

# 📣 What does this dbt package do?
- Materializes ReCharge staging tables which leverages data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/recharge#schemainformation). These staging tables clean, test, and prepare your ReCharge data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/recharge) for analysis by doing the following:
  - Name columns for consistency across all packages and easier analysis
  - Adds freshness tests to source data
  - Adds column-level testing where applicable. For example,  all primary keys are tested for uniqueness and non-null values.
- Generates a comprehensive data dictionary of your ReCharge data.
- These tables are designed to work simultaneously with our ReCharge transformation package (coming soon!).
